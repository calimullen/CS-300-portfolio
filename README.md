## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
The biggest issues I ran into while completing the projects in this course was trying to adapt and learn the new skills I needed as I progressed through the coursework. Specifically, learning how to fix code to run efficiently.
## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
Going into each problem, I wrote a plan for the specifications the client has set.  Mapping out the needs of the program first helped me to create a pathway to complete the project more effectively. Learning about the pros and cons to each data structure will help you create a better program. Knowing the size and speed of the data structure required will narrow down the choices for the best data structure for the project. 
## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Watching videos and using online resources helped me figure out the correct way to approach and solve issues. Going back into Zybooks and re-reading information to help better my understanding on the topics helped to solidify my knowledge before starting the projects. 
## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I realized that there are always multiple ways to go about designing and creating a program, even if I didnâ€™t think of the idea. I learned to broaden my mind a bit to uncover other solutions to the problem instead of choosing the first solution I think of. Other solutions may provide a better program or may be more efficient in the long run.
## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Before this course, I never considered building a program that was meant to last an extended period, because I never realized the importance of doing so. Building a product that is easily maintained and is easy to understand for the client has now become an aspect of development that will be consistent throughout the entire development process.
